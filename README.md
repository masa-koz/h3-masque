h3-masque
--
h3-masque is an implementation of the CONNECT-UDP protocol [RFC 9298](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9298/), based on [h3](https://github.com/hyperium/h3) and [MsQuic](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic). It provides both a client and a proxy implementation. It also supports the [Proxying Bound UDP in HTTP I-D](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-masque-connect-udp-listen/).

h3-masque is very early prototype with no thorough testing, poorly documented, and
very poor error and edge case handling.
